assessments using the Indian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and 
Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. Statistical analyses included 
chi-square tests and regression models.
RESULTS: Cognitive dysfunction was observed in 25% of participants (21.5% mild, 
3.5% moderate). Stress, anxiety, and depression were prevalent in 80.5%, 27%, 
and 30% of women, respectively. Lactational failure was reported by 21%, 
strongly correlated with cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.01) and mental health 
issues (stress, anxiety, and depression; P < 0.001). Key determinants of 
lactational failure included poor mother-partner relationships, lack of social

Patients With Schizophrenia: Do Psychotic Symptoms Play a Mediating Role?","INTRODUCTION: Depressive symptoms, bidirectionally associated with insomnia, are 
common comorbidity among patients with schizophrenia. The current literature 
lacks conclusive evidence about the mediating role of either positive or 
negative symptoms in the relationship between insomnia and depressive symptoms.
AIM/QUESTION: This study aimed to examine the mediating role of psychotic 
symptoms on the relationship between insomnia and depression in a sample of 
patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, mediational design was used in this cross-sectional 
study, using a convenience sampling method to recruit 279 patients with 
schizophrenia.
RESULTS: Insomnia total score ( β = 0.351, p < 0.001), work status ( β = 3.053, 
p < 0.001), living arrangement ( β = -2.071, p = 0.019), number of previous 
suicide attempts ( β = 1.087, p < 0.001) and medication adherence ( β = -1.456, 
p = 0.031) explained 41.9% of the variability in depression total score

40198082,5,Int J Gynaecol Obstet,Long-term morbidity of peripartum hysterectomy: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical removal of the uterus during pregnancy or immediately 
post-partum is called peripartum hysterectomy. It can be pre-planned as an 
elective or performed as an emergency life-saving procedure for severe 
hemorrhage. Although rare, it is a catastrophic event leading to severe maternal 
morbidity and a prolonged recovery period. Besides the well-documented acute and 
subacute sequelae, perpartum hysterectomy may produce long-lasting physical, 
social, and psychological impacts.
OBJECTIVES: Long-term complications of peripartum hysterectomy have barely been 
explored or recognized. The scattered information gathered from studies 
involving different corners of the world has yet to be synthesized or organized 
into coherent clusters of evidence. Therefore, the current study aims to fill 
the research gap by synthesizing the best available evidence, triggering the 
adoption of better management strategies.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Embase, PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane 
Library databases. Study selection was conducted using the semi-automated tool 
Rayyan.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Full-text articles published up to April 22, 2024 on 
randomized controlled trials, qualitative studies, cohort studies, case-control 
studies, cross-sectional studies, and case reports in the English language 
reporting long-term complications of peripartum hysterectomy were included, 
while review articles, book chapters, and studies reporting poor neonatal 
outcomes were excluded.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted under three broad themes: 
long-term quality of life, psychological outcomes, and women's experiences. Data 
synthesis involved a thematic analysis. Study quality assessment was conducted 
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme 
(CASP) tools. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the qualitative nature of 
the evidence and the heterogeneity of study outcomes.
MAIN RESULTS: There were no randomized controlled trials. Eighteen studies were 
analyzed (eight cohorts, one case-control, one case report, one cross-sectional, 
and seven qualitative) with 503 peripartum hysterectomy women. Overall, all the 
included studies showed solid methodological quality. Peripartum hysterectomy 
led to profound psychological impacts, including post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), depression, anxiety, and grief, with a fluctuating course over several 
months to decades. Peripartum hysterectomy significantly impaired quality of 
life, with declines in physical functioning, social functioning, and general 
mental health domains, which lasted several months to a few years. 
Self-narrations of women revealed breastfeeding issues, delayed emotional 
reactions, poor bonding with the infant, feelings of maternal failure, regrets 
for the loss of fertility, ongoing traumatic memories, persistent pain, 
dyspareunia, marital insecurity, and lack of family support, with some issues 
haunting them even decades later.
CONCLUSIONS: Traditional puerperium follow-up schedules do not meet the needs of 
women recovering from peripartum hysterectomy. The present study provides 
insights into the long-term physical, psychological, and social consequences of 
peripartum hysterectomy, prompting healthcare professionals to look for those 
actively. It may lead to early recognition of the complications, resulting in 
better patient-centered care and improved quality of life. Further, 
well-designed studies are warranted to raise awareness, plan appropriate 
interventions, and introduce follow-up guidelines.

Trial.","IMPORTANCE: There is limited evidence on the comparative effectiveness of 
different exercise modalities, such as yoga and strengthening exercises, for 
managing knee osteoarthritis (OA).
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of yoga vs strengthening exercise for 
reducing knee pain over 12 weeks in patients with knee OA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, assessor-blinded (for 
nonpatient-reported outcomes), parallel-arm, active-controlled, superiority 
randomized clinical trial included adults aged 40 years or older with knee OA 
and knee pain levels of 40 or higher on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) in 
Southern Tasmania, Australia. Participants were recruited from April 2021 to 
June 2022, and follow-up was completed in December 2022. Data were analyzed from 
May 2023 to July 2024.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to the yoga and strengthening 
exercise groups. Both groups attended 2 supervised and 1 home-based session per 
week for 12 weeks followed by 3 unsupervised home-based sessions per week for 
weeks 13 to 24.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the between-group difference 
in VAS score over 12 weeks assessed using a range of 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst 
possible pain) with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 10 mm. Secondary 
outcomes included knee pain over 24 weeks; Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain, function, and stiffness; 
patient global assessment; Osteoarthritis Research Society International-Outcome 
Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials response; physical performance 
measures; leg muscle strength; health-related quality of life assessed via the 
Assessment of Quality of Life-8 Dimensions (AQol-8D) utility score; depression 
assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and neuropathic pain 
assessment over 12 and 24 weeks. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat 
principle.
RESULTS: In total, 117 participants were randomized to the yoga (n = 58) or 
strengthening exercise (n = 59) program. Baseline characteristics of the 
participants were similar, with a mean (SD) age of 62.5 (8.3) years, and 85 
participants (72.6%) were female. The mean (SD) baseline VAS knee pain score of 
53.8 (16.0) indicated moderate knee pain. Over 12 weeks, the between-group mean 
difference in VAS knee pain change was -1.1 mm (95% CI, -7.8 to 5.7 mm), which 
was not statistically significant but remained within the prespecified 
noninferiority margin. Of 27 secondary outcomes assessed over 12 and 24 weeks, 7 
were statistically significant in favor of yoga. The yoga group showed modestly 
greater improvements than the strengthening exercise group (between-group 
differences) over 24 weeks for WOMAC pain (-44.5 mm [95% CI, -70.7 to -18.3 
mm]), WOMAC function (-139 mm [95% CI, -228.3 to -49.7 mm]), WOMAC stiffness 
(-17.6 mm [95% CI, -30.9 to -4.3 mm]), patient global assessment (-7.6 mm [95% 
CI, -15.1 to -0.2 mm]), and 40-m fast-paced walk test (1.8 [95% CI, 0.4-3.2]). 
In addition, the yoga group had a modestly greater improvement than the 
strengthening exercise for depression at 12 weeks (between-group difference in 
PHQ-9 score, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.2]) and quality of life at 24 weeks 
(between-group difference in AQoL-8D score, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.0 to 0.07]). Adverse 
events were similar in both groups and mild.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, yoga did not 
significantly reduce knee pain compared with strengthening exercises. However, 
yoga was found to be noninferior to strengthening exercises, suggesting that 
integrating yoga as an alternative or complementary exercise option in clinical 
practice may help in managing knee OA.

exercise groups. Both groups attended 2 supervised and 1 home-based session per 
week for 12 weeks followed by 3 unsupervised home-based sessions per week for 
weeks 13 to 24.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the between-group difference 
in VAS score over 12 weeks assessed using a range of 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst 
possible pain) with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 10 mm. Secondary 
outcomes included knee pain over 24 weeks; Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain, function, and stiffness; 
patient global assessment; Osteoarthritis Research Society International-Outcome 
Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials response; physical performance 
measures; leg muscle strength; health-related quality of life assessed via the 
Assessment of Quality of Life-8 Dimensions (AQol-8D) utility score; depression 
assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and neuropathic pain 
assessment over 12 and 24 weeks. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat 
principle.
RESULTS: In total, 117 participants were randomized to the yoga (n = 58) or 
strengthening exercise (n = 59) program. Baseline characteristics of the 
participants were similar, with a mean (SD) age of 62.5 (8.3) years, and 85 
participants (72.6%) were female. The mean (SD) baseline VAS knee pain score of 
53.8 (16.0) indicated moderate knee pain. Over 12 weeks, the between-group mean 
difference in VAS knee pain change was -1.1 mm (95% CI, -7.8 to 5.7 mm), which 
was not statistically significant but remained within the prespecified 
noninferiority margin. Of 27 secondary outcomes assessed over 12 and 24 weeks, 7 
were statistically significant in favor of yoga. The yoga group showed modestly 
greater improvements than the strengthening exercise group (between-group 
differences) over 24 weeks for WOMAC pain (-44.5 mm [95% CI, -70.7 to -18.3 
mm]), WOMAC function (-139 mm [95% CI, -228.3 to -49.7 mm]), WOMAC stiffness 
(-17.6 mm [95% CI, -30.9 to -4.3 mm]), patient global assessment (-7.6 mm [95% 
CI, -15.1 to -0.2 mm]), and 40-m fast-paced walk test (1.8 [95% CI, 0.4-3.2]). 
In addition, the yoga group had a modestly greater improvement than the 
strengthening exercise for depression at 12 weeks (between-group difference in 
PHQ-9 score, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.2]) and quality of life at 24 weeks 
(between-group difference in AQoL-8D score, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.0 to 0.07]). Adverse 
events were similar in both groups and mild.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, yoga did not 
significantly reduce knee pain compared with strengthening exercises. However, 
yoga was found to be noninferior to strengthening exercises, suggesting that 
integrating yoga as an alternative or complementary exercise option in clinical 
practice may help in managing knee OA.

less likely to benefit from psychological therapy is key to tackling 
inequalities in mental health treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To assess inequalities in the effectiveness of routinely delivered 
psychological therapy across religious groups and by the intersections with 
ethnicity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study including all 
patients who completed a course of treatment at 5 London-based National Health 
Service Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression (NHS TTad) services between 
2011 and 2020. Individuals reported their religion using routine patient records 
collected by the services. Data were analyzed from September 2023 to October 
2024.
EXPOSURES: Self-identified religion was categorized into (1) no religion, (2) 
Christian, (3) Muslim, and (4) other (which was further categorized into 
Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, and any other in a sensitivity analysis). 
Ethnicity was conceptualized as a potential confounder and separately as an 
effect modifier. Self-reported ethnicity was categorized based on UK Census 
codes into Asian, Black, mixed race, White, and other ethnic groups.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Psychological treatment outcomes used to assess NHS 
TTad services nationally, including reliable recovery, recovery, and reliable 
deterioration. Dropout from treatment was also examined. These outcomes were 
defined based on pre-post treatment changes in depression and anxiety symptom 
measures according to national guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 70 098 patients with data on self-reported religion were 
included in the study (mean [SD] age at referral, 39.2 [14.1] years; 47 797 
[68.2%] female). After adjusting for sociodemographic, treatment-related, and 
clinical characteristics, the odds of reliable recovery were higher in patients 
who did not have any religious belief (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26-1.42) 
or self-reported Christian (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.31-1.48) and other religion (OR, 
1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.34) compared with Muslim patients. While treatment outcomes 
improved each year in all groups, Muslim patients remained least likely to 
improve and more likely to deteriorate. There were interactions between religion 
and ethnicity; in particular, Muslim patients of White or other ethnic 
backgrounds had worse outcomes than Muslim patients of Asian, Black, or mixed 
race ethnic backgrounds and compared with non-Muslim patients of those 
ethnicities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In England, patients who identified as Muslim, and 
particularly those of White or other ethnicities, had poorer outcomes from 
psychological therapies for depression and anxiety disorders than patients who 
reported no religion or any other religion. This may be partly due to unmeasured 
characteristics that warrant further investigation (eg, nationality and 
asylum-seeking or refugee status). Best practice guidelines on working with

To estimate the prevalence of violence subtypes and analyze some demographic, 
socioeconomic, and health factors associated with violence against women in 
Brazil. Cross-sectional epidemiological study using the 2019 National Survey of 
Health. The prevalences of some violence subtypes (psychological, physical, and 
sexual) in the 12 months prior to the interview were estimated in the country, 
per federative units. The characteristics of each subtype of violence were also 
analyzed. Additionally, the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated 
by a multivariate model according to the following potential demographic, 
socioeconomic, and health associated factors: age group, education, skin color, 
place of residence, household income, marital status, social support network, 
self-rated health, alcohol consumption, depression, and sexually transmitted 
infections. In 2019, 19.38% of Brazilian women reported experiencing violence, 
with psychological violence being the most common subtype both in isolation and 
in conjunction with other subtypes. The main aggressor was an intimate partner 
and most of the violent acts occurred at home, with more than half of women 
reporting at least one consequence of these acts. Younger women, those with 
worse self-rated health, alcohol consumption, depression, and sexually 
transmitted infections had a higher prevalence of all violence subtypes. One in 
five Brazilian women reported experiencing violence in the past 12 months. 
Violence against women is positively associated with younger ages, lower 
education, Black and Brown skin color, smaller support networks, and 
health-related factors such as self-rated health, alcohol consumption, 
depression, and sexually transmitted infections."

METHODS: This qualitative study was nested within the 10/66 DRG LIFE2YEARS study 
in China. We conducted in-depth interviews with 49 older people and 13

expectations of health and social care and psychosocial support.
RESULTS: We used thematic analysis and developed three main themes: a) The 
interconnection of negative emotions, depression & social deficits, b) Reasons 
for social deficits- avoiding ""making trouble""; social exclusion/isolation; 
intergenerational strain, and c) Addressing unmet social needs. Older adults 
experienced loneliness as unexpected pain in later life. They practised 
withdrawal behaviours: to avoid social embarrassment and perceived risks to 
health. Older participants described living in communities where they felt 
increasingly alienated. Whilst some older people described effective strategies 
for counteracting loneliness, these were only feasible for those who were fit 
and able.
DISCUSSION: Our findings relating to the shame of loneliness and avoiding 
burdening others are particularly salient against a backdrop of Confucian

METHODS: For this study, a sample of 1,538 menstruating mothers with children 
aged 0 to 3 years (227 with 0-year-olds, 428 with 1-year-olds, 409 with 
2-year-olds, and 424 with 3-year-olds) was assessed utilizing the Premenstrual 
Dysphoric Disorder Scale (PMDDS), Parental Acceptance and Action Questionnaire 
(PAAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
RESULTS: The interaction effects between PMDDS and PAAQ scores were found to be 
significantly associated with anxiety and positive parenting, after controlling 
for other variables. Notably, higher PAAQ scores were associated with increased 
positive parenting, even in the presence of worsened PMDD symptoms. Furthermore, 
psychological flexibility, as measured by the PAAQ, had an independent effect on 
both depression and anxiety, though no moderating effect was observed.

with baseline resting-state functional connectivity: a meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Current interventions for major depressive disorder (MDD) 
demonstrate limited and heterogeneous efficacy, highlighting the need for 
improving the precision of treatment. Although findings have been mixed, 
resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) at baseline shows promise as a 
predictive biomarker. This meta-analysis evaluates the evidence for baseline 
rsFC as a predictor of treatment outcomes of MDD interventions.
METHOD: We included MDD literature published between 2012 and 2024 that used 
antidepressants, non-invasive brain stimulation, and cognitive behavioral 
therapy. Pearson correlations or their equivalents were analyzed between 
baseline rsFC and treatment outcome. Nodes were categorized according to the 
type of brain networks they belong to, and pooled coefficients were generated 
for rsFC connections reported by more than three studies.
RESULT: Among the 16 included studies and 892 MDD patients, data from nine 
studies were used to generate pooled coefficients for the rsFC connection 
between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN), and 
within the DMN (six studies each, with three overlapping studies, involving 534 
and 300 patients, respectively). The rsFC between the DMN and FPN had a pooled 
predictability of -0.060 (p = 0.171, fixed effect model), and the rsFC within 
the DMN had a pooled predictability of 0.207 (p < 0.001, fixed effect model). 
The rsFC between the DMN and FPN and the rsFC within the DMN had a larger effect 
in predicting the outcome of non-invasive brain stimulation (-0.215, p < 0.001, 
fixed effect model) and antidepressants (0.315, p < 0.001, fixed effect model), 
respectively. Heterogeneity was observed in both types of rsFC, study design, 
sample characteristics and data analysis pipeline.
CONCLUSION: Baseline rsFC within the DMN and between the DMN and FPN 
demonstrated a small but differential predictive effect on the outcome of 
antidepressants and non-invasive brain stimulation, respectively. The small 
predictability of rsFC suggested that rsFC between the FPN and DMN and the rsFC 
within the DMN might not be a good biomarker for predicting treatment outcome. 
Future research should focus on exploring treatment-specific predictions of 
baseline rsFC and its predictive utility for other types of MDD interventions.

was to establish how different types of combined antidepressants affect serum

METHODS: Serum and salivary samples were collected from 53 patients receiving

to Tmax), 7 hours (corresponding to the t½ value), 24, and 72 hours. Patients 
were stratified according to the combined antidepressant medication.
RESULTS: Salivary esketamine levels were several-fold higher than the 
corresponding serum levels at all time points, and showed high inter-individual 
variability. Serum 20-min post-esketamine levels and AUC0-72 levels were 
significantly higher in patients on antidepressants known to inhibit different

vortioxetine. These changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of esketamine did not 
affect the clinical outcome of esketamine. However, changes in systolic blood 
pressure in response to esketamine positively correlated with serum esketamine 
levels, suggesting a reduction of esketamine dose in patients with 
cardiovascular comorbidity under treatment with paroxetine, fluoxetine,

40197167,1,J Headache Pain,"Associations between personality traits and pain experiences in trigeminal 
neuralgia.","BACKGROUND: Pain is influenced by many factors such as personality traits and 
nociceptive stimuli. This study identified personality traits in patients with 
trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and investigated the relationships between personality 
traits and pain perception, pain acceptance, anxiety, and depression.
METHODS: From March to June 2024, the personality traits of 50 patients with TN 
and 50 healthy controls (HC) were measured using the 50-item International 
Personality Item Pool representation of Goldberg markers for the Big-Five factor 
structure. Patients' pain perception, pain acceptance, anxiety, and depression 
were measured.
RESULTS: The mean neuroticism scores and median anxiety and depression scores of 
patients with TN were higher than those of HC (p = 0.006, p < 0.001, and 
p = 0.010). There were no significant differences in pain perception and pain 
acceptance according to the personality traits. The higher the neuroticism 
score, the higher the anxiety and depression scores (ρ = 0.437, p = 0.002 and 
ρ = 0.344, p = 0.014). The higher the anxiety score, the higher the pain 
catastrophizing score, and the lower the pain acceptance score (ρ = 0.488, 
p < 0.001 and ρ = -0.365, p = 0.009). Higher depression score was associated 
with a pain frequency of 11 or more times per 24 h (odds ratio = 1.243, 
p = 0.015). The higher the depression score, the lower was the pain acceptance 
score (ρ = -0.324, p = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TN, neuroticism was not associated with pain. 
However, higher levels of neuroticism were associated with higher levels of 
anxiety and depression, and higher levels of anxiety and depression were 
associated with higher pain catastrophizing or pain frequency, and lower pain 
acceptance. These results can be used to establish individualized treatments for 
patients with TN, that focus on their emotional states according to personality 
traits, such as adapting psychological therapies differently for individuals 
with high neuroticism.

p = 0.015). The higher the depression score, the lower was the pain acceptance 
score (ρ = -0.324, p = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TN, neuroticism was not associated with pain. 
However, higher levels of neuroticism were associated with higher levels of 
anxiety and depression, and higher levels of anxiety and depression were 
associated with higher pain catastrophizing or pain frequency, and lower pain 
acceptance. These results can be used to establish individualized treatments for 
patients with TN, that focus on their emotional states according to personality 
traits, such as adapting psychological therapies differently for individuals 
with high neuroticism.

40196968,3,Mayo Clin Proc,Trends in the Incidence of Hypertension Among Healthy Adults Across 6 Decades.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine long-term trends in the incidence of hypertension.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Healthy adults in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1962 to 
2012 were identified and studied with follow-up through 2024. One blood pressure 
(BP) reading for each calendar year (as available) through follow-up was 
identified. Hypertension was defined by BP ≥130/80 mm Hg or ≥140/90 mm Hg in 2 
different calendar years or by use of antihypertensive medication. Analyses were 
adjusted for calendar period, age, sex, race, tobacco smoking, nontobacco 
substance use, depression/anxiety, dyslipidemia; family history of diabetes 
mellitus or hypertension, body mass index, systolic and diastolic BP, and 
fasting blood glucose level. Cumulative incidence estimates of hypertension 
accounted for death as a competing risk and were adjusted to characteristics of 
the 2000-2012 subcohort.
RESULTS: There were 8323 healthy adults studied (mean age, 39 years). Risk 
factors for hypertension were older age, male sex, Black race, past and current 
tobacco smoking, current substance use, depression/anxiety, family history of 
diabetes or hypertension, higher systolic and diastolic BP, higher blood glucose 
level, higher body mass index, and period. For the baseline periods of 
1963-1969, 1970-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2012, the adjusted 20-year 
cumulative incidence of hypertension defined by BP ≥130/80 mm Hg was 45%, 47%, 
54%, 70%, and 67%; by BP ≥140/90 mm Hg was 22%, 24%, 26%, 35%, and 33%; and by

40196933,5,Diabetes Obes Metab,"Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, 
and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies.","SUMMARY: Recent advancements in weight-loss medications have sparked a 
lot of interest. The so-called GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (GLP-1RAs) 
have gained a lot of attention, because they have shown to be very effective, 
leading to significant weight loss in patients participating in clinical trials. 
GLP-1RAs, like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, help manage weight by 
mimicking hormones that control blood sugar and appetite. However, how these 
medications perform in real life can be different from the controlled settings 
of clinical trials, in which patients are carefully selected and their treatment 
plans closely followed. This literature review looks at how these medications 
are used and their effectiveness and safety in real-world settings. In real-life 
practice, GLP-1RAs are often less effective than in clinical trial conditions. 
This is usually because patients don't follow their medication plans as strictly 
as in trials. Real-world data shows that many patients use lower doses and do 
not stick to their treatment as strictly as participants in a controlled trial 
might, leading to less weight loss. However, those who do follow their plans 
closely can achieve results similar to those in trials. A major issue with 
GLP-1RAs is that many patients stop using them within the first year due to side 
effects or high costs of the medications, especially if not covered by 
insurance. Common side effects include nausea and digestive problems, which are 
the main reasons patients stop taking these treatments. These side effects are 
often manageable and decrease over time, and this reviews found no strong 
real-world evidence that GLP-1RAs cause severe side effects in many users. 
Despite these challenges, when GLP-1RAs are used effectively and consistently, 
they show substantial benefits in weight loss, most so the newest medications 
semaglutide and tirzepatide. These medications are also likely to help manage 
and prevent weight-related health conditions like type 2 diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease, but evidence for these beneficial outcomes is still 
scarce in real-world settings. The review emphasizes the need for more research 
to understand why many patients stop using these medications and how to improve 
dosing. It also calls for studies on the long-term effects of these therapies on 
various health outcomes, including mental health, cardiometabolic health, 
cancer, and rare conditions like eye diseases. Overall, while GLP-1RAs are a 
valuable tool for weight management, their real-world use requires careful 
consideration of individual patient factors, such as the ability to stick to 
treatment plans, manage side effects, and afford the medications. Further 
research will help make these treatments more effective for a wider range of 
people that need them.

Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, 
and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies.

Thomsen RW(1), Mailhac A(1), Løhde JB(2)(3), Pottegård A(4).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as key agents 
for weight management, based on their marked efficacy as observed in randomized 
controlled trials. While still limited, real-world studies on GLP-1RA use in 
populations with obesity are increasingly available. This narrative review 
discusses contemporary real-world evidence demonstrating the utilization, 
clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the currently 
approved GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide 
and tirzepatide. The observed weight reduction in clinical practice overall 
tends to be lower than in randomized controlled trials; however, outcomes 
approach those seen in trials when focusing on highly adherent patients. 
Real-world studies demonstrate high discontinuation rates of GLP-1RAs (20%-50%) 
within the first year, and the use of much lower doses than those evaluated in 
clinical trials. Evidence from observational studies within type 2 diabetes or 
obesity populations suggests frequent gastrointestinal disturbances in GLP-1RA 
users, as also observed in trials, but no clear increase in risks of severe 
events like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, thyroid disorders, or depression 
and self-harm. Further evidence is needed to understand possible real-world 
associations of GLP-1RAs with eye disease and other rare outcomes. We provide 10 
areas of particular importance for further research on GLP-1RA within the 
real-world space, including improved understanding of the exact drivers of early 
discontinuation and suboptimal dosing, studies of the effects of stopping 
GLP-1RA treatment, and investigations of clinical and cost-effectiveness for 
hard clinical outcomes in real-world settings, including not only 
cardio-reno-metabolic outcomes but also obesity-induced diseases like 
neuropsychiatric disease, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and infections. PLAIN

controlled trial (RCT) compared an exercise group with World Health Organization 
(WHO)-compliant PA (150 min aerobic exercise and 2 resistance 
training-sessions/week) vs. activity as usual (control group).
METHODS: Thirty-four newly diagnosed consecutive MM patients were randomized 1:1 
to exercise vs. control groups. Guided training (2×/week) was performed for 
3 months during bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone (VCd) induction. PA 
was monitored using smartwatches and diaries. Demographics, osteolytic lesions, 
infections, fatigue, depression, and biomarkers (albumin, creatine kinase, 
C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide) were compared in exercise vs. control cohorts. 
VCd-tolerance, response, 'timed-up-and-go-test' (TUGT), Revised Myeloma 
Comorbidity Index (R-MCI), QoL (SF-12 questionnaire), event-free survival and 
trainer assignment during the training period were assessed (13 tests at 
baseline, during VCd and end of treatment [EOT]).
RESULTS: The exercise group was more than twice as active as the control group, 
with an average aerobic activity of 162 versus 68 min/week, respectively. 
Trainer-guided muscle-strengthening exercises were performed 2×/week in the 
exercise group, in line with WHO recommendations. These data were monitored via 
smartwatches and training diaries. PA proved to be safe: No exercise-related 
SAEs or accidents occurred. The study adherence was 94% (32/34). In the exercise 
versus control group, AEs to VCd induction (6% vs. 25%), therapy intolerance (6% 
vs. 25%) and hospitalization (31% vs. 50%, respectively) occurred less 
frequently. VCd-dose adjustments in the exercise vs. control group were 
significantly less needed (6.3% vs. 37.5%, respectively). At EOT, patients in 
the exercise group showed less fatigue (6% vs. 75%), less depression (6% vs. 
44%), better TUGT (6 vs. 11 s, respectively), improved R-MCI and QoL compared to 
the control group. Grip strength (right hand: 73-82 lb; left hand: 68-72 lb) 
significantly improved from baseline to EOT in the exercise group. Biomarkers 
did not significantly differ in both groups, but response to VCd-induction and 
event-free survival were improved in the exercise group, however, without 
reaching statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: PA in MM patients during induction is feasible and can improve 
fatigue, depression, TUGT, grip strength, comorbidities and QoL. More sport 
intervention offers are warranted to advance exercising in MM.

interval [CI] = 0.40-1.75, p = 0.002), physical balance ability (mean difference 
[MD] = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.23-1.37, p < 0.01), physical walking ability 
(MD = 48.39, 95% CI = 8.06-88.72, p = 0.02), and quality of life. However, 
exercise had no significant effect on depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.2, 95% 
CI = -0.46-0.05, p = 0.11). A subgroup analysis indicated that a longer duration 
of exercise (> 3 months) can effectively improve depressive symptoms in stroke 
patients.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that cognitive function, balance, walking 
speed, and quality of life of stroke patients improved following exercise 
intervention, and longer exercise duration (> 3 months) contributed to 
alleviating the depressive symptoms of stroke patients. Therefore, we recommend 
that stroke patients engage in physical exercise 3 times a week for 1 h each 
session. The exercise duration should continue for at least 3 months to ensure 
the best therapeutic effect. Furthermore, determining exercise intensity should 
be a personalized process-carefully customized to align with the physical 
capabilities and limitations of each patient.

BACKGROUND: Stroke patients often experience sequelae such as depressive 
symptoms, cognitive impairment, and abnormal physical function. Exercise 
intervention may be an effective and safe non-drug treatment to address these 
health issues.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analytical review was to explore the effects of 
exercise intervention programs on depressive symptoms, cognitive function, 
physical function, and quality of life in stroke patients, as well as to 
identify appropriate exercise programs.
METHODS: Seven databases were searched from the library's construction until 30 
August 2024. A meta-analysis was performed, and the risk of bias was assessed 
using Review Manager 5.4. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using Stata 16.0 
software, and the overall certainty of the evidence was rated using Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.
RESULTS: A total of 11,607 studies were identified. Among these, 20 studies, 
which included 1,848 patients, were considered eligible for this network 
meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, exercise significantly improved 
cognitive function (standard mean difference [SMD] = 1.08, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.40-1.75, p = 0.002), physical balance ability (mean difference 
[MD] = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.23-1.37, p < 0.01), physical walking ability

Synaptic editing of frontostriatal circuitry prevents excessive grooming in 
SAPAP3-deficient mice.

Walder-Christensen KK, Soliman HA, Calakos N, Dzirasa K.

Synaptic dysfunction has been implicated as a key mechanism underlying the 
pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Most pharmacological therapeutics for 
schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 
major depressive disorder temporarily augment chemical synapse function. 
Nevertheless, medication non-compliance is a major clinical challenge, and 
behavioral dysfunction often returns following pharmacotherapeutic 
discontinuation. Here, we deployed a designer electrical synapse to edit a 
single class of chemical synapses in a genetic mouse model of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Editing these synapses in juvenile mice 
normalized circuit function and prevented the emergence of pathological 
repetitive behavior in adulthood. Thus, we establish precision circuit editing 
as a putative strategy for preventative psychotherapeutics.

condition that causes exercise intolerance and ultimately death. Skeletal muscle 
derangements contribute to depressed exercise capacity in PAH, but the 
mechanisms underlying muscle dysfunction including the changes in muscle biology

METHODS: We evaluated exercise capacity, muscle histopathology, mitochondrial 
density, mitochondrial proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics of quadriceps ( 
predominately fast fibers ) and soleus ( predominately slow fibers) muscles in 
the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model of PAH.
RESULTS: MCT rats exhibited impaired exercise capacity. Surprisingly, there were 
divergent atrophic and metabolic remodeling in the quadriceps and soleus muscles 
of MCT rats. In the quadriceps , there was a mild atrophic response only in type 
II fibers. In contrast, both type I and II fibers atrophied in the soleus . Both 
muscles exhibited fibrotic infiltration, but mitochondrial density was reduced 
in the quadriceps only. Mitochondrial proteomics and tissue 
metabolomics/lipidomics profiling demonstrated the two muscles exhibited 
distinct responses as the quadriceps had impairments in oxidative 
phosphorylation/fat metabolism and storage of triacylglycerides. However, the 
soleus showed signs of proteasome deficiencies and alterations in 
phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine homeostasis. Finally, profiling of 
metabolites/lipids in the serum identified potential novel biomarkers of 
exercise intolerance in PAH including the dimethylarginine pathway, cysteine,

40196448,10,Front Hum Neurosci,"Investigating low intensity focused ultrasound pulsation in anhedonic 
depression-A randomized controlled trial.","INTRODUCTION: Anhedonic depression is a subtype of depression characterized by 
deficits in reward processing. This subtype of depression is associated with 
higher suicide risk and longer depressive episodes, underscoring the importance 
of effective treatments. Anhedonia has also been found to correlate with 
alterations in activity in several subcortical regions, including the caudate 
head and nucleus accumbens. Low intensity focused ultrasound pulsation (LIFUP) 
is an emerging technology that enables non-invasive stimulation of these 
subcortical regions, which were previously only accessible with 
surgically-implanted electrodes.
METHODS: This double-blinded, sham-controlled study aims to investigate the 
effects of LIFUP to the left caudate head and right nucleus accumbens in 
participants with anhedonic depression. Participants in this protocol will 
undergo three sessions of LIFUP over the span of 5-9 days. To investigate 
LIFUP-related changes, this 7-week protocol collects continuous digital 
phenotyping data, an array of self-report measures of depression, anhedonia, and 
other psychopathology, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after the 
LIFUP intervention. Primary self-report outcome measures include Ecological 
Momentary Assessment, the Positive Valence Systems Scale, and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire. Primary imaging measures include magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
and functional MRI during reward-based tasks and at rest. Digital phenotyping 
data is collected with an Apple Watch and participants' personal iPhones 
throughout the study, and includes information about sleep, heart rate, and 
physical activity.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to investigate the effects of LIFUP to the 
caudate head or nucleus accumbens in depressed subjects. Furthermore, the data 
collected for this protocol covers a wide array of potentially affected 
modalities. As a result, this protocol will help to elucidate potential impacts 
of LIFUP in individuals with anhedonic depression.

prevention and control policy to full openness, leading to a widespread pandemic 
within a short period. This study aimed to examine the trajectories of stress, 
anxiety, and depressive symptoms among Chinese university students within 1 year 
after the implementation of the open policy. Additionally, it investigated the 
influence of sleep quality, psychological resilience, and medical specialization 
on these psychological trajectories.
METHODS: A cohort study was conducted among Chinese university students using 
stratified sampling. Follow-up assessments were conducted at three time points: 
T1 (December 2022-January 2023), T2 (May-June 2023), and T3 (December 
2023-January 2024). Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate mean 
differences in symptom levels over time and to examine the influence of sleep 
quality, psychological resilience, and medical specialization on these changes.
RESULTS: At T1, a total of 2,062 university students were recruited. By T3, the 
follow-up rate was 63.43%, resulting in a final analytical cohort of 1,308 
participants. Among them, 769 (58.8%) were female, and 539 (41.2%) were male. 
The majority (54.7%, n = 716) were between 19 and 22 years old. Stress, anxiety, 
and depression levels were highest among Chinese university students at the 
beginning of the open policy and gradually decreased over the following year. 
Students with poor sleep quality and poor psychological resilience exhibited 
worsening psychological trajectories, which showed more severe and persistent 
symptoms. Medical and Nonmedical students consistently exhibited similar 
psychological trajectories.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the present study indicated that the change of 
COVID-19 prevention and control policy had more serious negative impacts on the 
mental health of Chinese university students than the epidemic itself. Thus, 
strengthening psychological treatments and psychosocial interventions for 
university students would be crucial in the context of a protracted infectious 
disease epidemic.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 33,285 students (grades 
3-6; mean age = 10.36 years) in the Shapingba District of Chongqing, China, from 
September to December 2020. Self-report measures included the Children's

RESULTS: The reporting rates of depression and self-harm in grades 3-6 of 
primary school are 16.3% and 12.7%, respectively. Parental separation exhibited 
a more pronounced overall impact on self-harm (β = 0.120) compared to divorce (β 
= 0.105). Positive classmate relationships mitigated the indirect effect of 
separation on self-harm mediated by depression, reducing it from 0.098 to 0.072. 
Additionally, these relationships attenuated the direct effect of divorce on 
self-harm, decreasing it from 0.088 to 0.043. Depression significantly mediates 
the relationship between parental separation and children's self-harm, with

Cameroon: Implications for Global Health in Low-income Countries.","OBJECTIVES: Bereaved parents of pediatric cancer patients 
frequently experience severe grief and psychological distress, but studies on 
the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and complicated grief (CG) 
among this population in Cameroon are lacking. This study aimed to determine the 
prevalence of MDD and CG among bereaved parents of deceased pediatric cancer 
patients treated at Mbingo Baptist Hospital Cameroon, and to identify predictors 
of these mental health outcomes.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included parents of deceased pediatric 
cancer patients treated at Mbingo Baptist Hospital between January 2015 and 
January 2022. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of MDD and 
CG as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: The prevalence of CG in this population was 86%, while 66.7% of the 
study subjects screened positive for MDD. Significant predictors of MDD included 
age [OR 1.091, p=0.018], financial hardship [OR 9.47, p=0.014], accurate 
knowledge of the child's prognosis [OR 0.268, p=0.046], perceived social support 
[(poor social support OR 6.402, P=0.039), (moderate social support OR 8.556, 
p=0.045)], and coping capacity [medium resilient copers OR 7.874, p=0.027]. 
Predictors of CG included age [OR 1.157, p=0.032], financial hardship [OR 
11.501, p=0.04], years passed since child loss [1-2 years OR 4.634, p=0.049], 
and coping capacity [(low resilient copers OR 14.011, p<0.01), (medium resilient 
copers OR 19.023, p<0.01)].
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed high prevalence of MDD and CG among bereaved 
parents of pediatric cancer patients in Cameroon. Financial difficulty, social 
support, and coping capacity had substantial impact on parental mental health 
outcomes in this population. Personalized mental health support services into 
pediatric oncology care is critical for assisting bereaved families and

Stress in utero: prenatal dexamethasone exposure causes greater structural 
gliovascular alterations in female offspring than in males.

Ferreira-Rodrigues M(#)(1)(2)(3)(4)(5), Sousa IS(#)(6), Baptista FI(6)(7)(8)(9), 
Coelho-Santos V(3)(4)(5).

From early in life, experiences like prenatal stress profoundly affect long-term 
health and behavior. Fetal exposure to increased levels of glucocorticoids (GC), 
via maternal stress or through antenatal corticosteroid therapy (commonly used 
in women at risk of preterm birth), can disrupt brain development and raise the 
susceptibility to psychiatric disorders. Previous studies on prenatal exposure 
to synthetic GCs, such as dexamethasone (DEX), revealed impairments in 
neurogenesis and dendritic spine development. However, the impact of prenatal 
stress, specifically antenatal DEX exposure, on the gliovascular interface 
remains unclear. This interface, involving the relationship between astrocytes 
and blood vessels, is essential for healthy brain development. Astrocytic 
endfeet coverage and organization are crucial features of the gliovascular 
interface, and in this study, we evaluated these aspects through aquaporin-4 
(AQ4) expression and organization along the lectin labelled-vasculature. At 
Postnatal Day 14, no differences in AQ4 expression were observed between males 
and females. However, prenatal stress induced by DEX exposure (50 μg/kg was 
administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice through gestational days 16, 17 and 
18) significantly impacted this structure in females but not in males. 
Specifically, in female offspring prenatally exposed to DEX, AQ4 expression was 
significantly upregulated in the hippocampus, and its rearrangement was observed 
in the prefrontal cortex. A comparison of vascular density between male and 
female brains showed no significant sex differences in any analyzed regions, 
though male cerebellar vessel segments were shorter. Interestingly, prenatal 
stress caused morphological alterations in female brains, including increased 
vessel tortuosity, while no such changes were seen in males. In the hippocampus, 
prenatal DEX exposure reduced vessel segment length in males but did not affect 
females. In the cerebellum, DEX exposure increased vessel segment length in 
females. This study highlights sex-specific differences in the impact of 
prenatal stress on the gliovascular structure across various brain regions, 
suggesting AQ4 as a potential molecular target relevant to depressive-like 
behaviors in female offspring. Future studies are needed to correlate the 
gliovascular structural alterations found with functional disturbances and 
sex-specific mental health issues.

Psychosocial Concomitants of Infertility: A Narrative Review.

Jain C(1), Khan W(1).

Infertility is a distressing and challenging condition that poses a significant 
social and public health concern. Among individuals of reproductive age, 
awareness of the factors associated with infertility is crucial. The prevalence 
of infertility has evolved over time, with distinct trends observable both 
globally and within India.  The primary objective of the study was to highlight 
the psychological and social factors associated with infertility. 
A comprehensive literature search was conducted to examine the psychological and 
social factors related to infertility. The electronic databases utilized for 
this search included PubMed and Google Scholar. The findings from the selected 
studies were synthesized into a narrative review. A total of 46 studies 
investigating the concomitants of infertility were analyzed. Among them, 32 
studies focused on psychological aspects, while 14 addressed social factors. The 
psychological aspects covered in the studies included quality of life (QoL), 
anxiety and depression, gender differences, psychiatric disorders, coping 
mechanisms, and subjective well-being. The social factors examined included 
partner dynamics - further categorized into sociodemographic influences, marital 
adjustment, and violence against women - family cohesion, lack of awareness, and 
socio-environmental influences. This review provides an overview of the 
psychological and social dimensions of infertility, while also identifying gaps 
in existing research. It underscores the need for further studies, particularly 
focusing on rural populations, increasing awareness among men, and understanding 
the impact of infertility-related violence. Ultimately, the research highlights 
the complexity of infertility and emphasizes the importance of continued 
research and intervention efforts to address its multifaceted implications.

Anesthetic Considerations for Cesarean Delivery in a Patient With Third-Degree 
Heart Block: A Case Report.

Rishi K(1), Ibrahim MA(1).

Congenital third-degree complete heart block (CHB) detected during pregnancy is 
a rare condition. This report discusses a pregnant patient with an incidental 
finding of CHB and its implications for maternal and fetal outcomes. A 
21-year-old female patient, gravida 2 para 0 (G2P0010), first registered at five 
weeks, two days gestation, with an incidental finding of third-degree heart 
block. Her baseline heart rate of 40-50 beats per minute, with no prior cardiac 
diagnosis. She had a history of miscarriage at six weeks' gestation. During the 
current pregnancy, she experienced two episodes of dizziness upon standing, each 
resolving within a minute without signs of hemodynamic instability. A 12-lead 
EKG and 24-hour Holter monitoring confirmed CHB, and echocardiography ruled 
out secondary causes. Cardiology and electrophysiology recommended temporary 
transcutaneous pacing and bedside atropine in case of instability. CHB in 
pregnancy is often congenital and characterized by independent ventricular 
activity due to atrial stimulus blockage. While typically asymptomatic, symptoms 
such as dizziness, hypotension, syncope, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest 
can occur. Pregnancy and labor stress, including the Valsalva maneuver, can 
exacerbate bradyarrhythmia, leading to adverse outcomes. Inadequate fetal 
perfusion and oxygenation can result in fetal bradycardia and hypoxia. 
Management requires a multidisciplinary approach, with echocardiograms, Holter 
monitoring, and, in some cases, cardiac MRI to rule out structural heart 
disease. Asymptomatic patients with good functional capacity may avoid permanent 
pacemakers, though temporary pacing is considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Neuraxial anesthesia is preferred for cesarean delivery in both symptomatic and 
asymptomatic CHB patients due to its minimal impact on myocardial function. 
General anesthesia should be avoided when possible. If necessary, anesthetic 
agents with minimal cardiac depression, such as ketamine, etomidate, rocuronium, 
and isoflurane, are recommended. Assisted early deliveries, such as vacuum or 
forceps, can help reduce the risk of Valsalva-induced bradycardia. Asymptomatic 
CHB cases without significant heart disease typically have favorable outcomes. 
However, careful cardiovascular monitoring and individualized care plans are 
essential to mitigate potential complications. Postpartum cardiology follow-up 
is necessary to assess the development of new symptoms and determine the need 
for a permanent pacemaker. This case highlights the importance of early 
diagnosis, adequate monitoring, early elective delivery, and multidisciplinary 
management in CHB during pregnancy. Neuraxial anesthesia and strategic labor 
management are key to ensuring positive maternal and fetal outcomes. Further 
research is needed to develop standardized guidelines for this rare condition.

Predicting Neurobehavioral Outcomes in People with HIV.

Ellis RJ, Tang B, Heaton RK, Patel P, Gonzalez J, Riggs PK, Iudicello J, 
Letendre SL.

We aimed to identify complex, multidimensional, longitudinal biopsychosocial 
phenotypes (MLBPSPs) in people with HIV (PWH) and evaluate their associations 
with baseline clinical characteristics. We included 506 PWH in the multi-site 
CHARTER study who underwent assessments at four visits, six months apart. Using 
machine learning, we identified four MLBPSP clusters based on means and 
non-linear trajectories of biopsychosocial characteristics. These 
characteristics included neurocognition, depressed mood, self-reported cognitive 
symptoms, and activities of daily living at each visit. The largest MLBPSP 
cluster (C1, N = 231) had the best average scores across all domains and 
remained stable over 18 months of follow-up. Other clusters showed varying 
degrees of cognitive impairment, depressed mood, and functional disability. In 
multivariable analyses, several baseline clinical characteristics, including 
chronic pulmonary disease, distal neuropathic pain, polypharmacy, and creatinine 
levels, significantly predicted one or more adverse MLBPSP trajectories. These 
findings have implications for HIV care by identifying PWH at risk for future 
adverse trajectories. The results may lead to insights informing future 
personalized interventions targeted to vulnerable subpopulations of PWH.

INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B is a highly contagious viral infection that has long 
been a significant global health concern. Given its adverse effects on the 
course of the disease, evaluating psychiatric outcomes is important. Despite 
indications of an increased risk of psychological outcomes among those with 
hepatitis B, the extent of this association remains unclear.
METHODS: This PRISMA-adherent systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42024564246) 
searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and PsycINFO for all studies evaluating the 
prevalence and risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms in individuals with 
hepatitis B. Random effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were used for 
primary analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 31 studies were included. We identified a high prevalence of 
depressive symptoms (Proportion=19%, 95% CI: 11-31) and anxiety (Proportion=30%, 
95% CI: 18-45) among individuals with hepatitis B. There was also a 
significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms (RR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.00-2.09, 
P=0.049) and anxiety (RR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.11-1.78) in individuals with hepatitis 
B compared to controls. Subgroup analyses indicated that older age and chronic 
hepatitis B infection were associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety and 
depressive symptoms. The systematic review found that being single, unemployed, 
having a lower income, a lower education level, high comorbidities, and a family 
history of mental illness were significant risk factors for poorer psychological 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights an increased vulnerability to anxiety and 
depressive symptoms among individuals with hepatitis B. We emphasize the urgent 
need for early detection and additional support for this at-risk group.

95% CI: 18-45) among individuals with hepatitis B. There was also a 
significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms (RR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.00-2.09, 
P=0.049) and anxiety (RR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.11-1.78) in individuals with hepatitis 
B compared to controls. Subgroup analyses indicated that older age and chronic 
hepatitis B infection were associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety and 
depressive symptoms. The systematic review found that being single, unemployed, 
having a lower income, a lower education level, high comorbidities, and a family 
history of mental illness were significant risk factors for poorer psychological 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights an increased vulnerability to anxiety and 
depressive symptoms among individuals with hepatitis B. We emphasize the urgent 
need for early detection and additional support for this at-risk group.

depression.","BACKGROUND: Xiaoyao Powder/Pill, as a classical Chinese herbal formula, has been 
widely used for treating depression. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Xiaoyao formula (XYF) as an adjuvant therapy for treating 
postpartum depression.
METHODS: We searched studies indexed in international databases (Cochrane 
Library, Embase, and PubMed) and Chinese databases (SinoMed, CNKI, and Wanfang). 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of XYF in combination 
with Western therapy compared to Western therapy alone for treating postpartum 
depression were eligible. The total response rate was defined as a reduction of 
more than 25% in depression scores, while clinical recovery was defined as a 
reduction of more than 75% in depression scores.
RESULTS: Our analysis included ten RCTs comprising 810 women. The combination of 
XYF and Western therapy led to a significant improvement in the total response 
rate (risk ratios [RR] 1.17; confidence intervals [CI] 1.08-1.26) and the 
clinical recovery rate (RR 1.56; 95% CI 1.27-1.91) compared to Western therapy 
alone. Additionally, XYF as an adjuvant therapy also significantly decreased 
Hamilton Depression Scale scores (standard mean difference [SMD] -1.69; 95% CI 
-2.37 to -1.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment with XYF can effectively alleviate depression in 
postpartum women. However, further well-designed RCTs are necessary to validate 
these findings, as the current evidence remains uncertain.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, characteristics, and associations of 
excessive digital screen time with students' mental health, sleep quality, and 
academic performance.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Southern University, Thailand, 
between December 2023 and January 2024. A total of 446 students completed 
self-administered questionnaires assessing DST characteristics, mental health, 
sleep quality, and academic performance. The tools used included the Depression 
Anxiety Stress Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. DST was analyzed by device type and average 
weekly usage hours, focusing on smartphones, tablets, and computers. EDST was 
defined as daily usage exceeding 8 hours for smartphones, 6 hours for tablets, 
or 5 hours for computers. Participants exceeding these thresholds on any device 
were classified as having EDST. Sampling was conducted using quota sampling 
across faculties. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests, rank sum tests, and 
logistic regression, with significance set at P<0.05.
RESULTS: Students' median age was 20 years (67.9% women). Most participants used 
smartphones for 4-6 hours daily (29.7%), tablets for <4 hours (29.8%), and 
computers for <4 hours (62.6%). Smartphones were primarily used for social media

younger age (AOR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66-0.94) and enrollment in health science 
faculties (AOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.01-2.86).
CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of EDST was observed among university students, 
particularly on smartphones and tablets. Younger students and those in health

hierarchical regression analysis. Memory impairments in the 
persistent-depression group were evident only for those feeling older. There 
were no effects of subjective age on fluency and numeracy tasks. Limitations 
include usage of self-report measures to assess depression, as well as applying 
a minimal inter-wave duration (2 years) to assess persistent depression. Results 
are aligned with a resource-stress account of subjective which claims that one's 
subjective age refelcts a ratio of resoucres-to-stress. Implications suggest 
that challenges of ageing in the shadow of depression can be compounded by 
feeling older, that memory (vs. other cognitive tasks) may be uniquely linked 
with subjective age, and that feeling older is a potential risk factor for 
impaired memory in persistent-depression. The importance of possible 
interventions aimed at lowering subjective age are mentioned.

among two or more constructs is removed, allowing researchers to examine the 
unique properties of the residualized, partialed, or unique portions of each

the difficulty faced in interpreting residualized variables, especially when the

analysis of demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment trends.","BACKGROUND: Real-world data on Peyronie's disease remains limited.
OBJECTIVES: Describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic 
management of Peyronie's disease patients in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the 
PearlDiver Mariner database (2010-2022). Male adults with Peyronie's disease 
were identified using the International Classification of Diseases codes. Data 
included demographics, clinical conditions, and treatments. Analysis was 
performed using R-based software.
RESULTS: Among 176,969 patients (mean age 58.9 years), hypertension (72.9%), 
diabetes (40.4%), and obesity (31.1%) were the most common comorbidities. 
Smoking was prevalent in 41.5%. Dupuytren's contracture affected 3.1%, penile 
trauma 0.2%, erectile dysfunction 28.2%, and depression 19%. Most patients were 
from the southern US (42.9%). Social determinants of health were noted in 30.9%. 
Treatment was received by only 13.2%. Intraplaque injections were the most 
frequent therapy (7.2%) and showed an increasing trend (p = 0.014). Surgical 
interventions (8.1%) included plication (35.1%), grafting (13%), prosthesis 
implantation (36.2%), and multiple techniques (15.7%). Grafting was linked to 
higher de novo erectile dysfunction risk.
DISCUSSION: Hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are frequent among Peyronie's 
disease patients. Erectile dysfunction and depression are common within a year

the association is bidirectional. Few studies have examined the association 
between weight change and mental health over time. We aimed to provide further 
insight into the association between weight gain and mental health, with a focus 
on emotional eating and body dissatisfaction as mediating factors.
METHODS: Height and weight were self-reported upon registration, and in Spring 
2022, 2023, and 2024 in the Specchio cohort (Geneva, Switzerland). BMI

the odds of an upward BMI category transition from baseline to last follow-up. 
The associations of behavioural and psychosocial factors with BMI trajectories

estimated using regressions adjusted for age, sex, education, and physical

pathways.
RESULTS: Among 7388 participants (59% women, mean age 51 years), factors 
associated with increasing BMI over 4 years included financial hardship, short 
sleep duration, less physical activity, more leisure screen time, depressive and 
anxiety symptoms, and emotional eating (β range [95% CI] = 0.03 [0, 0.05]-0.12

[0.33, 0.38]) and poorer quality of life (β = -0.06 [-0.09, -0.03]) at 4-year 
follow-up after adjustment for anxiety and depressive symptoms at baseline. 
Emotional eating partly mediated the association between anxiety and depressive 
symptoms at baseline and increasing BMI, and between financial hardship and 
increasing BMI. Body dissatisfaction and poorer self-rated health partly 
mediated the association between increasing BMI and quality of life at 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Emotional eating and body dissatisfaction contribute to the 
association between BMI trajectories and mental health and should be considered 
in weight management and mental health promotion strategies.

depression in breast cancer survivors. This study examined the association 
between changes in key health behaviors and depression risk after breast cancer 
diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: This nationwide cohort study assessed 30,523 breast cancer survivors 
without a prior history of depression, focusing on changes in weight, smoking 
habits, alcohol consumption, and physical activity from pre- to post-cancer 
diagnosis. The primary outcome was incident depression, with adjusted hazard 
ratios and confidence intervals calculated to consider potential confounders.
RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 5.3 years (160,755 person-years), 
lifestyle changes post-diagnosis included decreases in smoking (2.8% to 0.9%) 
and alcohol consumption (24.9% to 7.5%) and an increase in physical activity 
(18.9% to 32.1%). Substantial weight gain (> 10%) was associated with a 27% 
elevated risk of depression compared to those who maintained weight. Both 
continuation and cessation of smoking were associated with increased depression 
risk compared to sustained non-smokers. Changes in alcohol consumption, either 
initiation or cessation, were associated with increased depression risk compared 
to sustained non-drinkers. Conversely, breast cancer survivors who became 
inactive post-diagnosis had a reduced risk of depression compared to those who 
remained inactive. Our exploratory analysis showed that regular physical 
activity prior to diagnosis was associated with a 7% lower risk of depression 
compared to inactivity.
CONCLUSION: We observed that post-diagnosis weight gain exceeding 10%, 
sustaining or quitting smoking, starting or stopping alcohol consumption, and 
pre-diagnosis physical inactivity were all associated with an increased risk of 
depression in breast cancer survivors. Healthcare providers should support 
healthy behaviors to mitigate depression risk after breast cancer diagnosis and 
treatment.

(18.9% to 32.1%). Substantial weight gain (> 10%) was associated with a 27% 
elevated risk of depression compared to those who maintained weight. Both 
continuation and cessation of smoking were associated with increased depression 
risk compared to sustained non-smokers. Changes in alcohol consumption, either 
initiation or cessation, were associated with increased depression risk compared 
to sustained non-drinkers. Conversely, breast cancer survivors who became 
inactive post-diagnosis had a reduced risk of depression compared to those who 
remained inactive. Our exploratory analysis showed that regular physical 
activity prior to diagnosis was associated with a 7% lower risk of depression 
compared to inactivity.
CONCLUSION: We observed that post-diagnosis weight gain exceeding 10%, 
sustaining or quitting smoking, starting or stopping alcohol consumption, and 
pre-diagnosis physical inactivity were all associated with an increased risk of 
depression in breast cancer survivors. Healthcare providers should support 
healthy behaviors to mitigate depression risk after breast cancer diagnosis and 
treatment.

Behaviors Among Men Who Have Sex with Men and Women: Findings from the ADAPT- 2 
Trial.","BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) use has been linked to engaging in sexual risk 
behaviors (SRBs) that are associated with HIV/STIs, particularly among men who 
have sex with men (MSM) and men who have sex with men and women (MSMW; hereafter 
MSM/W). The objectives of this analysis were to determine whether reduced MA is 
associated with decreases in SRBs in a sample of MSM/W.
METHOD: Data came from the ADAPT- 2 trial, a randomized, double-blind, two-stage 
sequential parallel design trial evaluating extended-release injectable 
naltrexone (NTX) and oral bupropion (BUP) vs. placebo for MA use disorder. In 
the first 6 weeks of the trial (stage 1), participants were randomized to 
receive NTX-BUP or placebo. In the second 6 weeks, participants in the placebo 
group who did not have a treatment response were rerandomized (stage 2). For 
this secondary analysis, the independent variable was the number of MA-negative 
urine drug screens (UDS). The dependent variables included three different types 
of SRBs. Regression models of the independent and dependent variables were 
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity status, marital status, treatment assignment, 
and baseline SRBs.
RESULTS: Of the 151 participants, median age was 40 years and majority were 
non-Hispanic white (52%) and completed more than high school education (82%). 
Each additional MA-negative UDS was associated with a 7% (adjusted rate ratio 
(aRR) = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87, 0.99) reduction in total number of sex partners in 
stage 2 only. Each additional MA-negative UDS was associated with a 13% (aRR 
= 0.87 95%; confidence interval (CI), (0.76, 0.98)) and 9% (aRR = 0.91; 95% CI, 
0.84, 0.99) reduction in number of condomless sexual encounters in stage 1 and 
stage 2, respectively. Lastly, each additional MA-negative UDS was associated 
with a 16% (aRR = 0.84; 95% (CI), 0.75, 0.94)) and 27% (aRR = 0.73; 95% CI, 
0.64, 0.84) reduction in number of sexual encounters when high on MA.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed that reductions in MA use was associated with 
reductions in several sexual risk behaviors associated with HIV/STI. These 
findings provide further support for exploring reductions in sexual risk 
behaviors as a clinical endpoint in future treatment interventions for MA use.

OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis assessed the reliability generalization of the 
PHQ- 9 across different populations, settings, and cultural contexts to 
determine its applicability in global mental health assessments.
METHODS: A reliability generalization (RG) meta-analysis was conducted on 60 
studies with 232,147 participants. A random-effects model was used to estimate 
pooled internal consistency (Cronbach's α) and test-retest reliability. Subgroup 
analyses examined the effects of administration modes, cultural adaptations, and

RESULTS: The pooled Cronbach's α was 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.87]), indicating high 
internal consistency. Test-retest reliability, based on eight studies, was 0.82

anxiety and depression in young adulthood: The HUNT study.","BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a recognized risk factor for anxiety and depression, 
yet research on its interaction with low resilience remains sparse, particularly 
across the adolescent-to-adult transition. This study investigates how 
adolescent loneliness, both independently and in interaction with low 
resilience, influences anxiety and depression in young adulthood.
METHODS: This study utilized longitudinal data from The Trøndelag Health Study 
(HUNT) to track adolescents (13-19 years) from Young-HUNT3 (2006-08) through to 
HUNT4 (2017-19). Loneliness was assessed via a single-item measure, while 
resilience was estimated using the Resilience Scale for Adolescents. Anxiety and 
depression outcomes at the 11-year follow-up were measured using the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were 
done to analyze the associations. Moreover, interaction effects were evaluated 
using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).
RESULTS: Loneliness during adolescence independently predicted anxiety and 
depression in young adulthood. Adolescents experiencing both loneliness and low 
resilience showed notably higher risks compared to other groups (highly 
resilient adolescents without loneliness [reference], highly resilient 
adolescents with loneliness, and adolescents with low resilience and low 
loneliness). The combined effect of loneliness and low resilience exhibited a 
synergistic interaction on the additive scale, although it was not statistically 
significant (RERI 0.13, 95% CI -2.39-2.65).
CONCLUSION: Adolescent loneliness and low resilience independently predict 
anxiety and depression in young adulthood. The interaction between loneliness 
and low resilience further heightens these risks. This underscores the 
importance of early interventions that focus on resilience-building during 
adolescence and reducing the impacts of loneliness on mental health.

in rats from females stressed during pregnancy].","OBJECTIVE: To study the psycho-emotional state and its relationship to the 
duration of ultrasonic vocalization in the offspring of rats with physiological 
and stress-complicated pregnancy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiments were performed on the offspring (n=120) of 
rats with physiological pregnancy and the offspring of animals stressed during 
the entire gestation period (21-23 days). Study animals were divided into the 
following groups: 1 - intact - males and females (n=52) born to healthy rats; 2 
- stress - males and females (n=68) born to rats that underwent stress during 
pregnancy.
At the age of 17 days, the total vocalization duration (at 50 kHz) was recorded 
in rats. To assess the psycho-emotional state of the offspring, the open field 
and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 22 days, marble burying at 35 
days, and Porsolt forced swimming test at 47 days. To assess cognitive function 
in the offspring, short-term working memory was examined in the recognition of a 
new object test at 35 days and long-term memory in the conditioned passive 
avoidance reflex test at the age of 47 days.
RESULTS: The results of the open field and elevated plus maze tests indicated 
that the offspring of females stressed during pregnancy showed anxious behavior. 
In addition, animals from stressed rats exhibited compulsive and depressive 
behaviors in the marble burying and Porsolt forced swimming tests. The offspring 
of stressed rats showed impaired reproduction of the memory traces in the 
conditioned passive avoidance reflex test.
CONCLUSION: In the offspring of females stressed during pregnancy, anxious, 
compulsive, and depressive behavior is observed, accompanied by an increase in 
the duration of ultrasonic vocalization at 50 kHz.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Изучение психоэмоционального состояния и его 
взаимосвязи с длительностью ультразвуковой вокализации у потомства крыс с 
физиологической и осложненной стрессом беременностью.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Эксперименты были выполнены на потомстве (n=120) крыс с 
физиологической беременностью и потомстве животных, подвергшихся стрессорному 
воздействию в течение всего периода беременности (21—23 дня). Были сформированы 
группы: 1 — интактная — самцы и самки (n=52), рожденные здоровыми крысами; 2 — 
стресс — самцы и самки (n=68), рожденные крысами, которые подверглись 
стрессированию во время беременности.
В возрасте 17 дней у крысят регистрировали суммарную длительность вокализации 
(частота — 50 кГц). Для оценки психоэмоционального состояния потомства проводили 
тесты «Открытое поле» и «Приподнятый крестообразный лабиринт» в возрасте 22 
дней, «Закапывание шариков» в возрасте 35 дней и «Принудительное плавание по 
Porsolt» в возрасте 47 дней. Для оценки когнитивных функций у потомства 
исследовали кратковременную рабочую память в тесте «Распознавание нового 
объекта» в возрасте 35 дней и долговременную память в тесте «Условный рефлекс 
пассивного избегания» в возрасте 47 дней.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Результаты тестов «Открытое поле» и «Приподнятый крестообразный 
лабиринт» свидетельствовали от том, что у потомства стрессированных в течение 
беременности самок наблюдается тревожное поведение. Кроме того, животные от 
стрессированных крыс проявляли компульсивное и депрессивное поведение в тестах 
«Закапывание шариков» и «Принудительное плавание по Porsolt». Потомство 
стрессированных крыс демонстрировали нарушения сохранности памятного следа в 
тесте «Условный рефлекс пассивного избегания».

OBJECTIVE: To study the psycho-emotional state and its relationship to the 
duration of ultrasonic vocalization in the offspring of rats with physiological 
and stress-complicated pregnancy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiments were performed on the offspring (n=120) of 
rats with physiological pregnancy and the offspring of animals stressed during 
the entire gestation period (21-23 days). Study animals were divided into the 
following groups: 1 - intact - males and females (n=52) born to healthy rats; 2 
- stress - males and females (n=68) born to rats that underwent stress during 
pregnancy.
At the age of 17 days, the total vocalization duration (at 50 kHz) was recorded 
in rats. To assess the psycho-emotional state of the offspring, the open field 
and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 22 days, marble burying at 35 
days, and Porsolt forced swimming test at 47 days. To assess cognitive function 
in the offspring, short-term working memory was examined in the recognition of a 
new object test at 35 days and long-term memory in the conditioned passive 
avoidance reflex test at the age of 47 days.
RESULTS: The results of the open field and elevated plus maze tests indicated 
that the offspring of females stressed during pregnancy showed anxious behavior. 
In addition, animals from stressed rats exhibited compulsive and depressive 
behaviors in the marble burying and Porsolt forced swimming tests. The offspring 
of stressed rats showed impaired reproduction of the memory traces in the 
conditioned passive avoidance reflex test.
CONCLUSION: In the offspring of females stressed during pregnancy, anxious, 
compulsive, and depressive behavior is observed, accompanied by an increase in 
the duration of ultrasonic vocalization at 50 kHz.

взаимосвязи с длительностью ультразвуковой вокализации у потомства крыс с 
физиологической и осложненной стрессом беременностью.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Эксперименты были выполнены на потомстве (n=120) крыс с 
физиологической беременностью и потомстве животных, подвергшихся стрессорному 
воздействию в течение всего периода беременности (21—23 дня). Были сформированы 
группы: 1 — интактная — самцы и самки (n=52), рожденные здоровыми крысами; 2 — 
стресс — самцы и самки (n=68), рожденные крысами, которые подверглись 
стрессированию во время беременности.
В возрасте 17 дней у крысят регистрировали суммарную длительность вокализации 
(частота — 50 кГц). Для оценки психоэмоционального состояния потомства проводили 
тесты «Открытое поле» и «Приподнятый крестообразный лабиринт» в возрасте 22 
дней, «Закапывание шариков» в возрасте 35 дней и «Принудительное плавание по 
Porsolt» в возрасте 47 дней. Для оценки когнитивных функций у потомства 
исследовали кратковременную рабочую память в тесте «Распознавание нового 
объекта» в возрасте 35 дней и долговременную память в тесте «Условный рефлекс 
пассивного избегания» в возрасте 47 дней.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Результаты тестов «Открытое поле» и «Приподнятый крестообразный 
лабиринт» свидетельствовали от том, что у потомства стрессированных в течение 
беременности самок наблюдается тревожное поведение. Кроме того, животные от 
стрессированных крыс проявляли компульсивное и депрессивное поведение в тестах 
«Закапывание шариков» и «Принудительное плавание по Porsolt». Потомство 
стрессированных крыс демонстрировали нарушения сохранности памятного следа в 
тесте «Условный рефлекс пассивного избегания».
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: У потомства стрессированных во время беременности самок наблюдается 
тревожное, компульсивное и депрессивное поведение, которые сопровождаются 
увеличением длительности ультразвуковой вокализации на частоте 50 кГц."

markers CCL5, slCAM-1, sVCAM-1, NCAM, PAI-1, and MPO in the groups of patients 
with Parkinson's disease (PD) at various stages according to Hoehn and Yahr.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 533 patients with PD. All patients 
underwent a clinical neurological examination to determine the stage of PD, the 
severity of motor disorders according to the MDS-UPDRS scale (Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale of the Movement Disorder Society), and testing 
using validated questionnaires: Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Fatigue Severity 
Scale, Scale for assessing autonomic disorders in PD patients. Behavioral 
disorders were evaluated using QUIP-RS. 144 PD patients had their serum 
concentration of several inflammatory markers measured (CCL5, slCAM-1, sVCAM-1, 
NCAM, PAI-1, and MPO) on the MAGPIX multiplex analyzer (Luminex, USA) using xMAP 
Technology. Genotyping of polymorphic variants of CCL5 (rs2107538) and PAI-1 
(rs2227631) genes was performed using real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The serum levels of slCAM-1, sVCAM-1, CCL5, and NCAM varied in PD 
patients depending on the Hoehn and Yahr stage and disease duration. 
Correlations of serum marker levels were found both among themselves and with 
motor and non-motor disorders, which indicate a systemic inflammatory profile 
when increased peripheral production of CCL5, slCAM-1, sVCAM-1, NCAM, PAI-1, and 
MPO may play a role in the neurodegenerative process.
CONCLUSION: The serum level of inflammatory markers, such as CCL5, slCAM-1, 
sVCAM-1, NCAM, PAI-1, and MPO, in PD patients varies depending on the stage of 
the progressive neurodegenerative process, indicating the importance of systemic 
inflammation during PD.

also higher in Tg2576 CON mice in comparison with WT CON mice. Remarkably, we 
found a decrease in S1P brain levels and an increase in S1P serum levels of 
Tg2576 WAS mice in comparison with Tg2576 CON mice. Accordingly, WAS induced 
group further decreased S1P levels in the brains. However, the level in the 
serum further increased in comparison with non-induced group. Therefore, these 
results suggest that AD and depression could be associated, and that Tg2576 
transgenic mice are more susceptible to stress-induced depression through the 
release of S1P by SPNS2 up-regulation."

40194932,10,Can J Urol,"Mind matters: how anxiety and depression shape low-risk prostate cancer active 
surveillance adherence in a real-world population.","PURPOSE: While the mental health impact of a prostate cancer diagnosis, 
including low-risk prostate cancer, is well-documented, the effect of 
pre-existing anxiety and/or depression on adherence to active surveillance 
protocols in low-risk prostate cancer patients remains unclear. This study 
assessed the association between prior anxiety and/or depression and active 
surveillance adherence in men with low-risk prostate cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study involving 426 men 
diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer who were recommended active surveillance 
as the primary management strategy. Active surveillance adherence was defined by 
completion of both a prostate-specific antigen test and a prostate biopsy within 
18 months of diagnosis. Premature treatment was identified as definitive 
treatment, either through radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.
RESULTS: Men with a prior mental health diagnosis were significantly less likely 
to adhere to active surveillance than those without such a diagnosis (27.6% vs. 
49.5%, p = 0.006). These individuals had lower adherence rates for 
prostate-specific testing (58.6% vs. 73.4%) and biopsy (27.6% vs. 50.0%) and 
were more likely to abandon active surveillance in favor of immediate treatment 
(39.7% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.005). No significant differences were observed between 
patients with both anxiety and depression versus those with a single diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing anxiety and/or depression is associated with reduced 
active surveillance adherence and a greater likelihood of premature treatment in

addressing psychiatric factors in low-risk prostate cancer management and

with classic RTT and one with atypical RTT. Of 18 women tested for MECP2 
mutations, pathogenic variants were identified in 14. There was little increase 
in severity over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found that: (1) milder phenotypes were common; (2) 
depression may be under-recognised; (3) menopause does not seem to occur early; 
(4) nutrition standards from the general population will often be inapplicable; 
(5) multiple opportunities exist to prevent functional decline through detailed 
attention to the quality of the medical and social care.

markers in Parkinsonian cynomolgus monkeys.","OBJECTIVE: Anxiety and depression are common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's 
disease, but its underlying mechanism and treatment are still unclear. The key 
factor to solve this problem is to systematically establish an objective 
evaluation system of anxiety and depression-like behavior on a suitable PD 
animal model and reveal its pathological changes in the brain.
METHODS: Ten male cynomolgus monkeys were chosen, with five undergoing 
construction of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced 
left-sided symptoms-predominant PD model, following individualization 
principles. The PD model's reliability was validated via the Kurlan score and 
L-dopa efficacy test. Five healthy cynomolgus monkeys served as the control 
group with no interventions. Initially, a modified and simplified device was 
established to detect anxiety-like and depression-like behavior. Subsequently, 
ten cynomolgus monkeys were assessed for anxiety-like behavior using the human 
Intruder test (HIT) and novel fruit test (NFT). Depression-like behavior was 
evaluated using the progressive ratio test (PRT) and the apathy feeding test 
(AFT). Upon completion of behavioral tests, brain tissue from three cynomolgus 
monkeys that underwent PD modeling and three normal monkeys was utilized from 
the existing tissue bank. Initially, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining was 
conducted in the substantia nigra region using the immunohistochemical method to 
verify dopamine neuron loss extent. Subsequently, TH, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 
(TPH2), dopamine-β hydroxylase (DβH), and c-Fos protein, associated with 
neuronal activity, were stained in the three anxiety and depression-related 
brain regions: hippocampus, locus coeruleus, and amygdala, respectively, to 
explore changes in biomarkers related to anxiety and depression in the brain.
RESULTS: In this study, all PD cynomolgus monkeys selected exhibited consistent 
and stable PD symptoms, primarily characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, 
tremor, and postural flexion. Following MPTP modeling, there was no spontaneous 
recovery observed over 3 months. A modified and simplified device for screening 
anxiety and depression-like behavior was developed, and behavioral tests were 
conducted. The HIT assessed four behavioral phenotypes: anxious behavior, 
aggressive behavior, pacing, and sitting posture. The PD group displayed evident 
anxious behavior in a natural state, exhibited defensive behavior tending to 
inhibit actions after stress, and showed reduced aggression toward intruders. In 
the NFT, the PD group demonstrated lower uptake rates of novel and familiar 
fruits and took longer to reach for fruit compared to the control group, 
indicating anxiety-like behavior. The PRT revealed a lower breakpoint for food 
intake in the PD group, suggesting reduced motivation for food, although no 
significant difference was noted between the groups. In the AFT, the PD group 
exhibited lower consumption rates and prolonged fruit-taking time, indicative of 
reduced motivation and depression-like behavior. Immunohistochemical analysis of 
brain tissue revealed substantial loss of dopamine neurons in the left 
substantia nigra in the PD group, confirming the PD model from a pathological 
standpoint. Moreover, TPH2 expression was notably elevated in the amygdala 
region of the PD group, with a significant increase in c-Fos protein expression 
observed in the same region. TH expression levels were diminished in the 
hippocampus region, while DβH expression levels in the locus coeruleus and 
amygdala region were significantly higher than those in the control group, 
indicating pathological changes associated with anxiety and depression in PD 
cynomolgus monkeys.
CONCLUSIONS: This study was conducted in order to test anxiety and depressive 
symptoms in a typical PD monkey model, as well as anxiety and depression-related 
pathological changes in their brains. Behavioral tests revealed that PD monkeys 
exhibited anxiety-like behavior characterized by behavioral inhibition and 
depression-like behavior characterized by lack of motivation. 
Immunohistochemical staining revealed impairment of dopaminergic, serotonergic, 
and noradrenergic systems and hyperactivation of c-Fos protein in the brains of 
PD monkeys. These results provide technical support and scientific basis for 
evaluating non-motor behaviors in the psychopathology of Parkinson's disease, 
preclinical efficacy assessment, and further research on the pathogenesis of 
Parkinson's disease.

Adverse childhood experiences with physical, depressive, and cognitive 
multimorbidity among Chinese adults and the mediating role of loneliness.

Zhang T(1), Liu R(2), Li Y(3), Shi W(4), Luo L(5).

Little is known about the associations between adverse childhood experiences 
(ACES) and physical, depressive, and cognitive (PDC) disorders and their 
multimorbidity. Moreover, no study has assessed whether loneliness mediates any 
such associations. Using a nationally population-based study in China, we aimed 
to investigate the associations between ACES and PDC disorders and their 
multimorbidity among 11,124 middle-aged and older adults. Eight categories of 
outcomes including no disorders, physical disorder, depressive symptoms, 
cognitive disorder, and their four combinations were assessed. Twelve ACES 
indicators were measured using a validated questionnaire. Multivariate logistic 
regression and stratification analyses were performed to explore the association 
between ACES and PDC disorders and their multimorbidity, as well as potential 
modifiers. Mediate analyses were applied to examine the potential pathways via 
loneliness. Of the 11,124 individuals (45.8 % women, mean [SD] age: 60.1 [8.9] 
years), 79.3 % had at least one ACE. Compared with individuals without ACES, 
those who had four or more ACES had elevated risks of PDC disorders and their 
multimorbidity. The estimated odds ratios (OR) were 2.95 (95 % CI: 2.46-3.54) 
for physical-depressive multimorbidity, 1.59 (1.28-1.98) for physical-cognitive 
multimorbidity, 2.58 (2.01-3.31) for depressive-cognitive multimorbidity, and 
2.91 (2.15-3.96) for PDC multimorbidity, respectively. There is an

The effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on menopausal symptoms: A 
systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Wang H(1), Wang H(2), Kwok JYY(3), Tang S(4), Sun M(5).

BACKGROUND: Menopause, a crucial transitioning stage for women, can 
significantly impact mood and wellbeing. We aimed to systematically examine the 
effectiveness of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on health outcomes, 
including menopausal symptoms, quality of life (QOL), sleep quality, anxiety, 
depressive symptoms, stress, mindfulness levels, and female sexual function 
index.
METHODS: Eight databases were searched from inception to November 4, 2024 for 
randomized controlled trials. Two researchers independently selected, extracted, 
and appraised trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's 'risk of bias' tool. 
Meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, and 
meta-regression were performed using Stata 18.0. The Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the quality 
of evidence.
RESULTS: A total of 19 studies (1670 participants) published between 2011 and 
2024 were identified. Of these, 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. 
Compared with control group, The pooled analysis demonstrated that MBIs had 
statistically significant effects on menopausal symptoms (SMD, -2.10; 95 % CI, 
-3.49 to -0.70), QOL (SMD, -0.88; 95 % CI, -1.67 to -0.09), sleep quality (SMD, 
-0.92; 95 % CI, -1.65 to -0.20), anxiety (SMD, -1.03; 95 % CI, -1.42 to -0.66), 
depressive symptoms (SMD, -0.91; 95 % CI, -1.30 to -0.53), stress (SMD, -0.85; 
95 % CI, -1.55 to -0.15), and mindfulness levels (SMD, 1.19; 95 % CI, 0.35 to 
2.02). The overall quality of evidence for all pooled estimates were graded as 
low and moderate due to methodological limitations and small sample size. The 
low attrition rate (6 %) and relatively high adherence rate (79 %) highlight the

of the NHANES 2005-2023 August.","BACKGROUND: The ketogenic diet (KD) is widely used for epilepsy and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamate, the excitatory neurotransmitter in the 
body, has been found to be significantly elevated in the brains of some patients 
with depression. Ketone bodies, the main products of KD, may negatively regulate 
the metabolic activity of glutamate, which suggests a potential role in the 
onset and progression of depression. However, the relationship between KD and 
depression risk remains uncertain.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2005 and August 2023 to 
investigate the association between the ketogenic diet ratio (KDR) and 
depression risk. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to examine 
this association, whereas nonlinear relationships were assessed using restricted 
cubic splines. Stratification analysis was employed to examine the association 
between KDR and depression severity. Subgroup analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: In a fully adjusted model accounting for confounding variables, KDR was 
significantly associated with depression risk. Two-piecewise linear regression 
analysis better fitted the association (KDR < 0.35, OR: 0.11; 95%CI: 0.03-0.35;

depression was particularly pronounced in certain specific populations. We 
further observed a significant correlation between KDR and depression severity

lower odds if they maintained to be physically active before and after 
depression diagnosis (from period 0 to period 2). We found epidemiologic 
evidence that longitudinal evaluation for MVPA from pre-depression state may be 
important on analyzing depression-related risk.

40194594,7,Brain Stimul,"Personalized models of BeamF3 targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation for 
depression: Implications for precision clinical translation.","BACKGROUND: Clinical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for depression 
routinely relies on the scalp-based BeamF3 targeting method to identify 
stimulation targets in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC). Scalp-based 
targeting offers a low-cost and easily implemented method for TMS coil 
placement, enhancing treatment availability. However, limited anatomical and 
functional specificity of the BeamF3 method may affect treatment outcomes, 
motivating assessment of the clinical standard.
METHODS: In a naturalistic clinical trial of TMS conduced at four Veterans 
Affairs hospitals, the authors evaluate the BeamF3 method using neuroimaging 
incorporated before TMS, after five treatment sessions, and after all thirty 
sessions. Personalized anatomical and electric field (E-field) models were 
developed to assess target location and network engagement, as well as 
subsequent effects on clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Anatomical models demonstrate that the BeamF3 method produced reliable 
targets in the dLPFC across individuals and repeated treatment sessions. E-field 
models revealed that baseline anticorrelation between the stimulation center and 
the sgACC was associated with antidepressant symptom response after five TMS 
sessions () and at the end of treatment (). Relatedly, E-field magnitude at the 
sgACC-anticorrelated peak in the prefrontal cortex correlated with symptom 
response throughout treatment (early treatment: ; end of treatment: ).
CONCLUSIONS: This work establishes that scalp-based targeting can produce 
reliable targets in the dLPFC and be successfully evaluated using a combination 
of neuroimaging and E-field modeling in pragmatic, multisite applications. 
Importantly, this investigation also found that significant network effects 
occur early in treatment and that BeamF3 targets can engage functional 
mechanisms in TMS.

METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 7 to June 6, 2024, 
using Google Trends data, specifically Relative Search Volume (RSV) from 2014 to 
2023. Relative Search Volume is a metric provided by Google Trends, it is 
normalized to a scale of 0-100, where 100 represents the peak popularity of a 
search item within the selected time frame and location. Various psychological 
diseases and treatment modalities were searched individually, with all data and

RESULTS: The analysis revealed an overall increase in annual search interest for 
various mental health conditions, with Anxiety peaking in 2023 and Depression 
reaching its highest Relative Search Volume (RSV) in 2019. While Bipolar 
Disorder (BPD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD) also showed an upward trend, their increases were less

Behavioral Therapy (DBT), significantly increased from 2019 to 2023 compared to 
2014-2018 (p < 0.05). In contrast, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) had higher

sensitization hypothesis.","BACKGROUND: Perinatal depressive symptoms (PDS) are a risk factor for maternal 
well-being during and following pregnancy as well as for infant development. 
COVID studies documented a definite increase in PDS during this period of 
heightened stress, but also highlighted that all women were not equally at risk 
of perinatal depression. This calls for the identification of factors that could 
contribute to sensitizing certain individuals to populational stressors such as 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: Based on the stress sensitization model, this study aimed to evaluate 
the associations between childhood trauma (CT) and depressive symptoms in 
pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic at four timepoints (two prenatal and 
two postnatal).
METHODS: A sample of Canadian mothers (N = 117, Mage = 29.77 years, SD = 3.18, 
63.2 % primiparous, 98.3 % White, 23.1 % with history of CT) completed

first or second (T1) and the third trimester of pregnancy (T2), as well as at 
2 months (T3) and 6 months (T4) postpartum. Structural equation modeling (SEM) 
analyses were performed using MPlus.
RESULTS: Maternal severity of CT was directly associated with pre- and postnatal 
depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. CT was also indirectly 
associated with postnatal depressive symptoms via prenatal depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: CT had an enduring association with postnatal depressive

Patients With Newly Diagnosed Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer in Germany: 
Predefined Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.","BACKGROUND: Due to its high incidence, prostate cancer (PC) imposes a burden on 
Western societies. Individualized treatment decision for nonmetastatic PC (eg, 
surgery, radiation, focal therapy, active surveillance, watchful waiting) is 
challenging. The range of options might make affected persons seek peer-to-peer 
counseling. Besides traditional face-to-face support groups (F2FGs), online 
support groups (OSGs) became important, especially during COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate utilization behavior and physician 
advice concerning F2FGs and OSGs for patients with newly diagnosed PC. We 
hypothesized greater importance of OSGs to support treatment decisions. We 
assumed that this form of peer-to-peer support is underestimated by the treating 
physicians. We also considered the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial comparing an online decision aid versus a printed brochure for patients 
with nonmetastatic PC. We investigated 687 patients from 116 urological 
practices throughout Germany before primary treatment. Of these, 308 were 
included before and 379 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the 1-year follow-up 
visit, patients filled an online questionnaire about their use of traditional or 
online self-help, including consultation behaviors or attitudes concerning 
initial treatment decisions. We measured secondary outcomes with validated 
questionnaires such as Distress Thermometer and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-4 items to assess distress, anxiety, and depression. Physicians 
were asked in a paper-based questionnaire whether patients had accessed 
peer-to-peer support. Group comparisons were made using chi-square or McNemar 
tests for nominal variables and 2-sided t tests for ordinally scaled data.
RESULTS: Before COVID-19, 2.3% (7/308) of the patients attended an F2FG versus 
none thereafter. The frequency of OSG use did not change significantly: OSGs 
were used by 24.7% (76/308) and 23.5% (89/308) of the patients before and during 
COVID-19, respectively. OSG users had higher levels of anxiety and depression; 
38% (46/121) reported OSG as helpful for decision-making. Although 4% (19/477) 
of OSG nonusers regretted treatment decisions, only 0.7% (1/153) of OSG users 
did (P=.03). More users than nonusers reported that OSGs were mentioned by 
physicians (P<.001). Patients and physicians agreed that F2FGs and OSGs were not 
mentioned in conversations or visited by patients. For 86% (6/7) of the 
patients, the physician was not aware of F2FG attendance. Physicians 
underestimated OSG usage by 2.6% (18/687) versus 24% (165/687) of actual use 
(P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are more aware of F2FGs than OSGs. Before COVID-19, 
F2FGs played a minor role. One out of 4 patients used OSGs. One-third considered 
them helpful for treatment decision-making. OSG use rarely affects the final 
treatment decision. Urologists significantly underestimate OSG use by their 
patients. Peer-to-peer support is more likely to be received by patients with 
anxiety and depression. Comparative interventional trials are needed to 
recommend peer-to-peer interventions for suitable patients.

Psychological eHealth Interventions for Patients With Cardiovascular Diseases: 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Su JJ(1)(2), Lin R(3), Batalik L(4)(5), Wong AKC(6), Grace SL(7)(8)(9).

BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is recognized as an independent risk factor 
for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), contributing to increased morbidity and 
mortality. While eHealth is increasingly used to deliver psychological 
interventions, their effectiveness for patients with CVDs remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of eHealth 
psychological interventions for patients with CVDs.
METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved from 5 databases (Embase, Medline, 
PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library), covering the period from database 
inception to December 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating 
the effect of evidence-based psychological eHealth interventions to improve 
psychosocial well-being and cardiovascular outcomes for people with CVDs were 
included. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (version 2) was used to judge the 
methodological quality of reviewed studies. RevMan (version 5.3) was used for 
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs, comprising 2319 participants from 10 countries, 
were included in the review. The results demonstrated significant alleviation of 
depressive symptoms for patients receiving psychological eHealth intervention 
compared to controls (number of paper included in that particular analysis, n=7; 
standardized mean difference=-0.30, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.14; I2=57%; P<.001). More 
specifically, in 6 trials where internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy was 
delivered, a significant alleviation of depressive symptoms was achieved 
(standardized mean difference=-0.39, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.21; I2=53%; P<.001). 
There was no significant change in anxiety or quality of life. Synthesis without 
meta-analysis regarding stress, adverse events, and cardiovascular events showed 
inconclusive findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological eHealth interventions, particularly internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy, can significantly reduce depressive symptoms among 
patients with CVDs. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for comprehensively 
improving psychological and cardiovascular outcomes. Future studies should 
explore integrating persuasive design features into eHealth and involving mental

mechano-energetic efficiency in older individuals.","AIMS: Altered myocardial mechano-energetic efficiency (MEE) is a 
significant predictor of cardiovascular events and heart failure. Among the 
potential pathophysiological factors underlying MEE impairment, insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may be a plausible candidate due to its role in the 
cardiovascular system. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between 
plasma IGF-1 concentrations and myocardial MEE in a cohort of older individuals 
aged >65 years, participating in the CATAnzaro MEtabolic RIsk factors (CATAMERI) 
study.
METHODS: Myocardial MEE per gram of left ventricular mass (MEEi) was measured in 
490 older subjects with a broad spectrum of glucose tolerance using 
echocardiography.
RESULTS: IGF-1 levels were positively associated with myocardial MEEi (r = 
0.200, P < 0.001). Individuals in the highest tertile (tertile 3) of IGF-1 
showed significantly lower heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption, 
alongside a significant increase in myocardial MEEi compared to those in the 
lowest tertile. In multivariate linear regression analysis, IGF-1 levels were 
identified as the major determinant of MEEi, independently of well-established 
cardio-metabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that low circulating IGF-1 levels are 
associated with depressed myocardial MEEi in older individuals. This highlights 
the potential importance of monitoring IGF-1 in clinical evaluations to assess 
cardiovascular health.

40193434,10,Health Psychol,"Sex-specific associations of depressive symptom trajectories with type 2 
diabetes mellitus in middle-aged and older adults: Findings from a nationwide 
cohort in China.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the sex-specific associations 
between depressive symptom trajectories and the risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM).
METHOD: This longitudinal study was based on the China Health and Retirement 
Longitudinal Study. Chinese residents aged ≥45 years with sufficient information 
were included in 2011-2015 and followed up in 2018. The sex-specific 
associations between depressive symptom trajectories and T2DM were calculated by 
Multivariable Cox frailty models. The population attributable fractions were 
used to quantify the risk of T2DM associated with trajectories of depressive 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Of the 2,949 males and 3,407 females included, 99 and 122 developed 
T2DM, respectively. We identified four depressive symptom trajectories in both 
sexes: maintained-low, decreasing, increasing, and maintained-high. Compared to 
those in maintained-low trajectory, females in all other trajectories had higher 
risks of T2DM (hazard ratios [HRs] ranged from 2.01 to 3.93). In comparison, 
only maintained-high (HR = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.42, 5.77]) and 
decreasing depressive symptom trajectories were associated with increased risk 
of T2DM (1.82, [1.10, 3.00]) in males. The T2DM risks attributable to 
maintained-high, increasing, and decreasing trajectories were 16.35%-23.75% in 
females. In males, maintained-high and decreasing trajectories accounted for 
9.14% and 11.98% of T2DM risks.
CONCLUSION: The sex-specific analysis revealed the trajectories with initially 
high levels of depressive symptoms were associated with T2DM in both sexes. 
Additionally, females exhibited an extra risk of T2DM associated with the 
increasing depressive symptoms trajectory. The findings necessitate monitoring 
and addressing depressive symptoms in preventing T2DM in both males and females.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the sex-specific associations 
between depressive symptom trajectories and the risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM).
METHOD: This longitudinal study was based on the China Health and Retirement 
Longitudinal Study. Chinese residents aged ≥45 years with sufficient information 
were included in 2011-2015 and followed up in 2018. The sex-specific 
associations between depressive symptom trajectories and T2DM were calculated by 
Multivariable Cox frailty models. The population attributable fractions were 
used to quantify the risk of T2DM associated with trajectories of depressive 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Of the 2,949 males and 3,407 females included, 99 and 122 developed 
T2DM, respectively. We identified four depressive symptom trajectories in both 
sexes: maintained-low, decreasing, increasing, and maintained-high. Compared to 
those in maintained-low trajectory, females in all other trajectories had higher 
risks of T2DM (hazard ratios [HRs] ranged from 2.01 to 3.93). In comparison, 
only maintained-high (HR = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.42, 5.77]) and 
decreasing depressive symptom trajectories were associated with increased risk 
of T2DM (1.82, [1.10, 3.00]) in males. The T2DM risks attributable to 
maintained-high, increasing, and decreasing trajectories were 16.35%-23.75% in 
females. In males, maintained-high and decreasing trajectories accounted for 
9.14% and 11.98% of T2DM risks.
CONCLUSION: The sex-specific analysis revealed the trajectories with initially 
high levels of depressive symptoms were associated with T2DM in both sexes. 
Additionally, females exhibited an extra risk of T2DM associated with the 
increasing depressive symptoms trajectory. The findings necessitate monitoring 
and addressing depressive symptoms in preventing T2DM in both males and females.
